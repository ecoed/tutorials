# Species Distribution Models & Climate Change projections
## _In the Biodiversity and Climate Change Virtual Laboratory (BCCVL)_

## Introduction
Species Distribution Models (SDM) can be used to understand the potential distribution of a species or the environmental suitability of locations based on a set of environmental conditions. This module addresses the fundamental aspects of species distribution models (SDM), the type of data needed for these models, different types of algorithms and evaluation of models as well as an understanding of Climate Change projections to investigate how species distributions might change in the future.

## Key Messages
- The design of a Species Distribution Model includes a few important aspects: species data (presence and absence), environmental data, and a modelling algorithm.
- It is important to understand which environmental factors influence your species when you design a Species Distribution Model.
- Depending on your research question, different evaluation statistics might be useful to evaluate the performance of your model.
- The two important components of a Climate Change Projection are the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) and the General Circulation Model (GCM).
- There are 4 RCPs, which represent four different climate change scenarios.

## Skills to be gained
- Designing a Species Distribution Model and Climate Change projection.
- Understanding differences in generating pseudo-absence records.
- Understanding differences in modelling algorithms.
- Being able to adequately evaluate model outputs.
- Understanding different climate change scenarios (RCP).
