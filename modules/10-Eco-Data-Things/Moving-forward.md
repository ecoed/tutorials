## What's next?

Well done! You have come to the end of this module and can now celebrate your new-found skills and knowledge, and hopefully put them into practice. But your EcoScience education journey can go much further! There are so many ways to keep in touch and up to date with data as well as familiarize yourself with other resources, tools and platforms that provide data and analytical tools. The info below is just a handful of resources for you to continue your journey.

### Further learning
There is still so much more to explore and learn! Check out one of these resources:
- Want to learn more about research data management? Browse the [23 (research data) Things program](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/skills/23-research-data-things), which includes data management issues not covered in this module.
- Explore other [ecoEd modules](ecoed.org.au/materials/) on the website.
- Make connections with other people who ‘know data’ in your institution e.g. librarians, repository managers, IT specialists, researchers.
- Join a [Research Bazaar](https://resbaz.github.io/resbaz2019/) event in your area! These events are a great way to learn more about digital skills and tools required to do their research better, faster and smarter.
- Sign up for one of the Carpentry workshops to increase your software and/or data skills: [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/), [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/), or [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org/). Data Carpentry has a specific workshop for [Ecology](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/#ecology-workshop)!
- Find an Online Open Course, such as:
  - [Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) on Coursera.
  - [Data Science Essentials](https://www.edx.org/course/data-science-essentials) on edX.
  - [Data Fundamentals](https://schoolofdata.org/courses/#DataFundamentals) on School of Data.

### Keep in touch
There are several ways to stay informed of what is happening:
- Sign up to the [ARDC newsletter](https://us7.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=b542ef52e49302569068046d9&id=22b849a4ee).
- Get social on Twitter and connect with [ecoEd](https://twitter.com/ecoEd_), [ARDC](https://twitter.com/ARDC_AU), [Research Data Alliance](https://twitter.com/resdatall).
- Many universities organize regular Hacky Hours: an informal catch up aimed at improving a researcher’s understanding and implementation of the technical aspects of research. Google ‘hacky hour’ and your university name to find out more.

If you have questions about this module, or want to discuss opportunities for workshops at your organization or collaborations, we would love to hear from you! Feel free to [contact us](ecoed.org.au/contact/) through the ecoEd website!
