# 10 Eco Data Things

10 Eco Data Things is an opportunity to explore issues surrounding management of research data, specifically for people working with ecological data.
This program was developed from the [23 (research data) Things](www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/skills/23-research-data-things) program and the extensive ANDS resources and materials related to research data management and reuse.

## How can I work through these 10 Eco Data Things?
- All Things have a choice of activities. You can pick'n'mix from the activities to suit your interests.
- You can do as much or as little of the Things and activities as you want to do, or need to know.
- Some of the activities are intended as an introduction to a topic and some delve a little deeper. Choose what interests you and suits your experience.
- You can work through activities on your own at your own pace or in a group.
- Set aside some time each week to do one Thing or do a ‘Crash course’ and work through them all in a few hours.

## You don't have to do them all
- You can do as much or as little of the Things as you want to do, or need to know.
- Choose from the different activities, doing one or all of them.
