## Thing 10: Spatial data
The importance of spatial data is ever increasing. Many of the societal challenges we face today such as food scarcity and economic growth are inherently linked to big spatial data. In fact, it is often said that 80% of all research data has a geographic or spatial component. It is useful then, for all of us to have an understanding of spatial data.

### Activity 1: Spatial data: maps and more
1.	Start by watching this incredible, inspiring video (3.59 min) from the University of Wollongong’s PetaJakarta project. It shows innovative ways of combining social media and geospatial data to save lives.
2.	Now read how GIS can be used in Conservation Biology.
3.	This video combines a range of different data visualisations depicting the human impacts on our environment.
4.	Geospatial data is fundamental to Australia’s economic future. Check out this very short article about how GeoScience Australia is mapping the mineral potential of our continent - a world first!

Just for fun: Enter your address in the Atlas of Living Australia and see what birds and plants have been reported in your street or suburb. You may be surprised at how ‘alive’ your street is!

**Consider:**  Why do you think these geospatial visualisations are so powerful?

### Activity 2: Spatial Data concepts
There are many types and sources of geospatial data. If you are new to the world of geospatial data, you will probably appreciate some ‘busting’ of the jargon of geospatial data.

1.	Start by reading this Fundamentals Chapter to learn more about maps, projections, coordinate systems, datums and GIS.
2.	Want more? Continue with this blog about Finding and Making Sense of Geospatial Data on the Internet which explains some basic geospatial data file formats and concepts.
3.	Prefer watching? Most of these concepts are also explained in this video.
4.	Read more about two important aspects of spatial data: scale and resolution.

**Consider:** How would you give an explanation of two new terms you have just learnt?
