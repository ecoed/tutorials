## Thing 3: What are publishers & funders saying about data?
Data sharing policies are becoming increasingly common in Australia and internationally.  Learn why research funders and journal publishers are particularly influential when it comes to encouraging data availability.

### Activity 1: Journal data policies
More and more journal publishers are asking authors to make the data underpinning a journal article available. It’s all about ensuring that the research being described in the article is based on solid, reproducible science.

Choose one of the links below to explore some journal publisher policies:

1.	[PLOS ONE Data policy](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability)
2.	[Springer Nature Data policy](https://www.springernature.com/gp/authors/research-data-policy)
3.	[Elsevier Data policy](https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/research-data)
4.	[Wiley Data Sharing and Citation policy](https://authorservices.wiley.com/author-resources/Journal-Authors/open-access/data-sharing-citation/index.html)

**Consider:** How easy, or hard, it was for you to understand what they are asking researchers to do in regard to research data?

### Activity 2: Data journals and data papers
Explore this relatively new form of data publishing: the data journal. Data journals focus on describing data, rather than discussion and analysis of the data (as in traditional journals).

1.	Data journals, such as [Scientific Data](https://www.nature.com/sdata/), are publications whose primary purpose is to expose datasets. They enable the author to focus on the data itself, rather than producing an extensive analysis of the data which occurs in the traditional journal model. Read this short introduction: [What are data journals?](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/publishing-and-reusing-data/data-journals)
2.	Ecology is a journal that accepts ‘data papers’ in addition to other more traditional papers. Browse:
a.	The [PanTHERIA data paper](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/08-1494.1), describing a species‐level data set compiled for analysis of life history, ecology, and geography of all known extant and recently extinct mammals.
b.	The [BAAD data paper](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/14-1889.1), describing the Biomass And Allometry Database for woody plants.
c.	The journal’s [data paper instructions](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/journal/19399170/resources/data_paper_inst_ecy).

**Consider:** Why do you think authors might choose to describe their data in data journals or journals that accept data papers?

### Activity 3: Research funders and data sharing
Funders of research are increasingly developing policies requiring data to be well managed and shared.

1.	Start by reading the [ARC Research Data Management policy](https://www.arc.gov.au/policies-strategies/strategy/research-data-management).
2.	Check out the [ANDS guide to filling out the data management section in ARC grant applications](https://www.ands.org.au/guides/arc-guide-to-filling-in-the-dm-section).
3.	International collaborations mean that research teams need to consider Australian as well as the data sharing policies of their overseas collaborators. Choose one of these major funders of research overseas and have a look at their data sharing policies:
a.	[National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/dmp.jsp) in the US, and note the Data Management Plan requirement (see Thing 4: Data Management Plans).
b.	[Wellcome Trust](https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/guidance/policy-data-software-materials-management-and-sharing) in the UK (1 page).

**Consider:** The ARC Research Data Management Policy says “Since 2007, the ARC has encouraged researchers to deposit data arising from research projects in publicly accessible repositories”. Why do you think this hasn’t happened across the all ARC funded research yet?
