## Thing 8: DOIs, data citation and metrics
DOIs are unique identifiers that support data citation, metrics for data and related research objects, and impact metrics. Citation analysis and citation metrics are important to the academic community. Find out where data fits in the citation picture.
Also note that unique identifiers are being developed for people too! Universities, funders and publishers worldwide are starting to use ORCID to differentiate between people with the same name by assigning a unique identifier. Interested? Start by checking out the ORCID website.

### Activity 1: DOIs
Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) are a type of ‘persistent identifier’. They are unique identifiers that provide persistent access to published articles, datasets, software versions and a range of other research inputs and outputs. There are over 120 million Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) in use, and in 2016 DOIs were “resolved” (clicked on) over 5 billion times!

Each DOI is unique but a typical DOI looks like this: http://doi.org/10.4225/08/50F62E0D359D5

1.	Start by watching this short 4.5 minute video Persistent identifiers and data citation explained from the Netherlands. It gives you a succinct, clear explanation of how DOIs underpin data citation.
2.	Have a look at the poster Building a culture of data citation and follow the arrows to see how DOIs are attached to data sets and are used in data citation.
3.	Let’s go to a CSIRO data record which shows how DOIs are used. Click on this DOI to ‘resolve’ the DOI and take us to the record: http://doi.org/10.4225/08/50F62E0D359D5
a.	Click on both the Description and Data tabs and note how many times the DOI is used in this data record.  It will give you some ideas why DOIs are given such prominence.
b.	This same record has been syndicated to Research Data Australia.
c.	Click on the Cite icon on the upper left of the record (under the green Go To Data Provider tab).
d.	Now click on the DOI in the data citation. No matter where the DOI appears it always resolves back to its original dataset record to avoid duplication. i.e. many records, one copy.
4.	DOIs can also be applied to grey literature, a term that refers to research that is either unpublished or has been published in non-commercial form, such as government reports. For example, reports like this: https://doi.org/10.4225/08/5ac520bd3fbc7

**Consider:** Should DOIs be routinely applied to all research outputs? Remember that DOIs carry an expectation of persistence (maintenance costs etc.) but can be used to collect metrics as well as link articles and data (evidence of impact).

### Activity 2: Altmetrics

Alternative metrics or ‘Altmetrics’ count the number of views, number of downloads, social media ‘likes’ and recommendations associated with a dataset. Because of their immediacy, altmetrics can be an early indicator of the impact or reach of a dataset; long before formal citation metrics can be assessed.

1.	Start by exploring the altmetrics for this Oecologia paper.
2.	Now look at the altmetrics for this Phylogenomics article published in Science. Note the number and pattern of downloads for this article since it was published in November 2014.
a.	Now click on the “donut” or the link to ‘More Details’ to see the wealth of information available.
b.	Look also at the associated data in Dryad noting that the data has been assigned a DOI. Can you see how many times the record has been viewed?
By way of comparison, as of early April 2016:
o	the same dataset had been cited once in Thomson Reuters Data Citation Index.
o	the article had been cited 143 times in Web of Science.

**Consider:** Do you think altmetrics for data have value in academic settings? Why, or why not?

### Activity 3: Citing research data
Data citation continues the tradition of acknowledging other people’s work and ideas. Along with books, journals and other scholarly works, it is now possible to formally cite research datasets and even the software that was used to create or analyse the data. DOIs can be used to collect citation metrics about the use of a dataset or article.

1.	Start by looking at this Weddell Seal dataset.  Check out how many times it has been cited. This citation count has been measured by the Clarivate Analytics Data Citation Index.
2.	Scan through the ANDS introduction to data citation and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) citation guidelines.

**Consider:** Data citation is a relatively new concept in the scholarly landscape and as yet, is not routinely done by researchers, or expected by most journals. What could be done to encourage routine citation of research data and software associated with research outputs?

If you have time: The Force11 Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles are a set of principles for citing data. They are based on the premise that data citation, like the citation of other evidence and sources, is good research practice and is part of the scholarly ecosystem supporting data reuse. Since they were published, the Principles have been endorsed by numerous individuals and more than 100 data centres, publishers and societies.
1.	Start by reading the Force11 Principles.
2.	Then browse the list of people and organisations that have endorsed the Principles.
