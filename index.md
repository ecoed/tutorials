# ecoEd Tutorials

_ecoEd_ is an innovative training and skills development program for university lecturers, researchers and industry professionals. The program is developed to enhance the translation of Australiaâ€™s eResearch infrastructure to the EcoScience community by educating and upskilling the next generation of environmental scientists and managers.

_ecoEd_ provides access to information resources that can be used in courses that focus on topics such as ecology, biogeography, environmental management and spatial analysis. These resources explain the theoretical underpinnings of ecological models, and provide real-world examples to show how these concepts can be analysed in online tools.
