# ecoEd Tutorials

This site contains tutorials for digital tools for ecosciences that are part of the _ecoEd_ program.

[_ecoEd_](https://www.ecoed.org.au) is an innovative training and skills development program for university lecturers, researchers and industry professionals. The program is developed to enhance the translation of Australiaâ€™s eResearch infrastructure to the EcoScience community by educating and upskilling the next generation of environmental scientists and managers.

_ecoEd_ provides access to information resources that can be used in courses that focus on topics such as ecology, biogeography, environmental management and spatial analysis. These resources explain the theoretical underpinnings of ecological models, and provide real-world examples to show how these concepts can be analysed in online tools.

This website provides online walk-through tutorials for each of the _ecoEd_ modules:
- [**10 Eco Data Things**](https://ecoed.github.io/tutorials/modules/10-Eco-Data-Things/10-Eco-Data-Things.html): a suite of activities to explore issues surrounding management of research data, specifically for people working with ecological data.
- [**Biodiversity Data Quality**](https://ecoed.github.io/tutorials/modules/Biodiversity-Data-Quality.html): addresses different aspects of data quality, and how to select biodiversity data that is fit for your purpose using the [Spatial Portal](https://spatial.ala.org.au/) of the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA).
- **Australian Ecological Data**: explores how to obtain and use spatial data from the suite of tools of the [Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN)](https://www.tern.org.au/) with a practical exercise getting data using the AusPlotsR package.
- [**Species Distributions & Climate Change**](https://ecoed.github.io/tutorials/modules/SDM-Climate-Change.html): addresses the fundamental aspects of modelling species distributions and -how a changing climate might affect biodiversity, and how to run these models in the [Biodiversity and Climate Change Virtual Laboratory (BCCVL)](http://www.bccvl.org.au/).
- **Multi-Criteria Analysis**: covering multiple aspects of multi-criteria analysis (MCA) and how to apply this knowledge in a free spatial software tool (MCAS-S).
- **Environmental Microbial Diversity**: explores how to assess the complexity and abundance of specific taxonomic groupings of microbes through combining DNA sequencing technology with bioinformatics approaches using Galaxy Australia.

Each module also includes ready-to-go lecture slides and teacher background information, which can be downloaded on the [_ecoEd_ website](https://www.ecoed.org.au/materials).
